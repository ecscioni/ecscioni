## "Experience"
Undergraduate at Fontys ICT (AI/ML), running interactive studies in machine-shaped learning—teaching small artificial agents to behave on purpose.  
Apprentice in responsible overfitting: controlled datasets, measurable regret, and reproducible notebooks (including the confusion).  
Acting Assistant to the Deputy Trainee of “Hello, World,” specializing in turning tutorials into slightly different tutorials.  
Exporter of “Works On My Laptop” to “Works Outside My Laptop,” with a rising success rate and fewer ritual restarts. 

## What I’m Like
- I break models politely until they confess their loss function.  
- Training myself and my models. One of us is converging.  
- I read docs after I ship. Growth mindset, but with commit history.  
- Self-deprecation enabled: I am a beginner engineered for unreasonable persistence.

## Operating Principles
- Ship small, ask good questions, version everything.  
- Tools are negotiable; curiosity isn’t.  
- If it’s not in a repo, it’s a rumor.

## Currently Learning
Studying at Fontys University of Applied Sciences—Department of Optimistic Debugging and Machine-Shaped Learning.  
Focus: statistically validated guesswork and artisanal tensors. Building tiny things that fail loudly and then behave.

- Python programming: small tools, cleaner functions, fewer print-based investigations.
- Machine learning & how models work: loss functions, train/val/test splits, over/underfitting, gradient-descent intuition.
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL): NASA C-MAPSS (starting FD001), predicting cycles left; MAE = average mistake in cycles.
- Mathematics (pre-calculus): rebuilding functions, trig, limits, so matrices stop bullying me in public.
- Vim keybindings: motions, macros, muscle memory; they don’t shoot lasers—it’s sharks now.
- Obsidian + LaTeX (VimTeX): tidy notes → tidy PDFs; macros behaving (mostly).
- Extra credit (satire): department-approved aura coding, revoked pending ethics; practicing ethically-sourced gradient whispering.
