## "Experience"
I am an AI engineering student at Fontys ICT specializing in applied machine intelligence, conducting precision-controlled Python development within GitHub-based version orchestration. I integrate mathematical modeling, neural abstraction, and trigonometric analysis as foundations for advanced ML pipelines built under CRISP-DM methodology, aiming toward autonomous data cognition through modular algorithmic refinement.
Acting Assistant to the Deputy Trainee of “Hello, World,” specializing in turning tutorials into slightly different tutorials.  

## What I’m Like
- I break models politely until they confess their loss function.  
- Training myself and my models. One of us is converging.  
- I am a beginner engineered for unreasonable persistence.

## Currently Learning
Studying at Fontys University of Applied Sciences Department of Optimistic Debugging and Machine-Shaped Learning.  
Focus: statistically validated guesswork and artisanal tensors. Building tiny things that fail loudly and then behave.

- Python programming
- Machine learning & how models work
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
- Mathematics (pre-calculus): so matrices stop bullying me in public.
- Vim keybindings
- Obsidian + LaTeX (VimTeX)

Extra credit: department-approved aura coding, revoked pending ethics; practicing ethically-sourced gradient whispering.
