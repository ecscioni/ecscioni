## "Experience"
Undergraduate at Fontys ICT (AI/ML), running interactive studies in machine-shaped learning, teaching small artificial agents to behave on purpose.  
Apprentice in responsible overfitting: controlled datasets, measurable regret, and reproducible notebooks (including the confusion).  
Acting Assistant to the Deputy Trainee of “Hello, World,” specializing in turning tutorials into slightly different tutorials.  

## What I’m Like
- I break models politely until they confess their loss function.  
- Training myself and my models. One of us is converging.  
- I am a beginner engineered for unreasonable persistence.

## Currently Learning
Studying at Fontys University of Applied Sciences Department of Optimistic Debugging and Machine-Shaped Learning.  
Focus: statistically validated guesswork and artisanal tensors. Building tiny things that fail loudly and then behave.

- Python programming
- Machine learning & how models work
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
- Mathematics (pre-calculus): so matrices stop bullying me in public.
- Vim keybindings
- Obsidian + LaTeX (VimTeX)

Extra credit: department-approved aura coding, revoked pending ethics; practicing ethically-sourced gradient whispering.
